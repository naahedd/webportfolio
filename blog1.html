            <p>In today's world, we find ourselves immersed in a mechanical, digital, fast-paced environment. Almost everything is accessible and attainable with the click of a button. Technology has undoubtedly improved our lives in countless ways... or has it?</p>
            
            <p>Consider the analogy of an animal kept well-fed, sheltered, and provided with every necessity. This animal, particularly a pet, will generally exhibit good behavior, content in its environment as long as its basic needs are met. But is the same true for humans?</p>
            
            <p>If we take a person and provide them with wealth, the finest house, the best lifestyle, gourmet food, and all the luxuries imaginable, will they behave as predictably as a pet? The answer, when it comes to human beings, is significantly different. Observing the world today and reflecting on the history of those who came before us, we see that humans often tend to misbehave when their stomachs are full and their material needs are overly satisfied. Evidence of this can be found in the high rates of suicide, drug addiction, psychological distress, and moral degradation among the wealthy and famous—those we often view as having "everything."</p>
            
            <p>This observation tells us that we cannot treat humans the way we treat animals. It is a flawed strategy to believe that making life "better" for humans simply involves making everything easier and pushing the ambition of a lavish lifestyle as the ultimate goal.</p>
            
            <p>What truly defines us as humans, I believe, are our moral values—concepts like sacrifice, dignity, freedom, honesty, and perseverance. These are not tangible like a house or money. They are intangible, not easily grasped by intellect alone. Unlike animals, humans are driven by more than just their immediate needs. We have never seen an animal rise against an oppressive leader or hate its life despite having all it could need. For humans, "better" is not defined by what is fast or easy, but rather by the ability to endure suffering, practice patience, and strive for something greater than mere survival.</p>
